# Getting Started with  App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



In the project directory, please run:
### `yarn` to install all required packages

### ''Update api key'
make sure to update api key in '\src\api\axiosSetup.ts'. at the moment it is setup for demo

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Could have done more testing if more time was available

### `things to improve or could have:-`
1) API Key should not be in the source file
2) Could have used context instead of redux
3) definitly, have more tests if its was live app
